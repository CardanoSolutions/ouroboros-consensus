### Non-Breaking

- `CardanoNodeToClientVersion12` now implies `ShelleyNodeToClientVersion8` in
  all Shelley-based eras instead of just in `Conway`. This means that downstream
  logic determining query availablity (eg in `cardano-api`) can (continue to)
  simply branch on the negotiated `NodeToClientVersion`.
