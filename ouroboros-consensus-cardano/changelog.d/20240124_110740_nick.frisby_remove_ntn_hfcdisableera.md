### Patch

- Improved Haddock comments that explain how to control which eras are enabled
  when constructing a `ProtocolInfo`.

### Breaking

- Removed `EraNodeToNodeVersion`, replacing it with `WrapNodeToNodeVersion`.
- Removed `CardanoNodeToNodeVersion3` and above, since they're all equivalent
  to `CardanoNodeToNodeVersion2` now.
