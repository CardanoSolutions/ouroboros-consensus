### Breaking

- The type system now prohibits Conway-specific queries for Shelley-based eras
  before Conway, by adding the `ConwayEraGov era` constraint to those query
  constructors.
- The new `getConwayEraGovDict` enables the decoder to find the necessary
  dictionaries and issue a specific error message if there isn't one.
