### Breaking

- ProtocolParams (CardanoBlock c) was monomorphized to `CardanoProtocolParams`
- Remove `cardanoProtocolParamsPerEra` from `CardanoProtocolParams` in favour of a single `cardanoProtocolVersion`.
  This patch intentionally removes the flexibility the n-ary product of versions per-era gave us, in favour of a simpler interface, as the current one has caused a lot of confusion and led to several mistakes in the past.
