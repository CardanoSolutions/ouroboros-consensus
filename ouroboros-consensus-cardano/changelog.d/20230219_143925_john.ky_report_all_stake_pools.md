### Breaking

- When querying `GetStakeSnapshots Nothing`, which means to query for all stake pools, previously
  only stake snapshots for stake pools that have the `Mark` ledger snapshot were returned.  With
  this change stake snapshots tfor stake pools that have the `Set` or `Go` ledger snapshots are
  returned as well.
