### Breaking

####  Added:
- `Conway` to `CardanoEras`
- `NodeToNodeV_11` and `NodeToClientV_15`, both of which enable Conway.
- Conway-related type and pattern synonyms. Eg `StandardConway`, `HeaderConway`,
  `GentTxConway`, etc.

#### Changed

- The `protocolInfoTPraosShelleyBased` and `protocolInfoPraosShelleyBased`
  functions now expect a tuple of the `AdditionalGenesisConfig` and the
  `TranslationContext` instead of just the `TranslationContext`. For all
  Shelley-based eras before Conway, those had been equal types.
