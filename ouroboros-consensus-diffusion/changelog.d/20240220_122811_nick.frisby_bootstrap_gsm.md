- A bullet item for the Patch category.

### Non-Breaking

- Added `getImmTipSlot` to `NodeKernel` exports.

### Breaking

- Added the Genesis State Machine (GSM), though for now it is merely the
  simpler [Bootstrap Peers State
  Machine](https://ouroboros-consensus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/docs/for-developers/BootstrapPeersIER).

- Added `rnGetUseBootstrapPeers` to `RunNodeArgs`, for dynamically
  enabling/disabling the GSM. The proper GSM must always be running, despite
  the TVar it owns being ignored when it's disabled, since it may be enabled at
  any time.

- Added `llrnMaxCaughtUpAge` to the low-level args; defaults to 20min.

- Added `gsmTracer` to the node's tracers.

- Added `getNodeIdlers` to the `NodeKernel` interface; tracking peers that have
  last sent `MsgAwaitReply`.
