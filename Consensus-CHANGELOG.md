# Consensus Changelog

The Consensus packages are organized in two bundles: the packages that are
ledger-agnostic and the packages that are Cardano specific. For each of these
bundles we keep a separate `CHANGELOG.md` file, and the version number of all
the packages in each bundle moves in lockstep.

The two Changelogs can be found here:
- [ledger-agnostic bundle](./ouroboros-consensus/CHANGELOG.md)
- [Cardano-specific bundle](./ouroboros-consensus-cardano/CHANGELOG.md)

If you have any doubts, please consult the [release
process](./ouroboros-consensus/docs/ReleaseProcess.md).
