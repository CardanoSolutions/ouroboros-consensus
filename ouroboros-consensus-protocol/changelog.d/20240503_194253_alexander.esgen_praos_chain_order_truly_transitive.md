### Non-Breaking

- Changed the Praos chain order such that for two blocks `A` and `B` by the same
  issuer with the same block number, `A` is now preferred over `B` only if `A`
  has a higher issue number *and* (new) `A` and `B` are in the same slot.

  This is in line with the motiviation for the issue number tiebreaker, and
  fixes the transitivity of the `Ord PraosChainSelectView` instance in a special
  case.
