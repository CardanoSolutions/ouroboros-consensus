### Patch

- `ouroboros-consensus` and `ouroboros-consensus-diffusion`: Since the
  filesystem API that lives in `ouroboros-consensus` will live in the `fs-api`
  package for now on, start depending on `fs-api`, and change imports
  accordingly.

<!--
### Non-Breaking

### Breaking

- `ouroboros-consensus`: Move the filesystem API that lives under
  `Ouroboros.Consensus.Storage.FS` and `Ouroboros.Consensus.Storage.IO` to a new
  package called `fs-api`. The original modules become deprecated.
