### Breaking

- Peer Sharing Integration:
  - Monomorphized `Handlers` client field types to `ConnectionId addr`;
    and added PeerSharing handlers.
  - Changed `mkHandlers` function to receive a function to compute peer sharing addresses;
  - Changed `Codecs` type and propagated changes to relevant functions (e.g. `defaultCodecs`);
  - Changed `Apps` type and propagated changes to relevant functions (e.g. `mkApps`);
  - `initiatorAndResponder` receives PeerSharing value;
  - Added PeerSharing field to `RunNodeArgs`;
  - Changed `runWith` to receive necessary parameters;
  - `NodeKernel` changes to incorporate PeerSharing miniprotocol (adds `PeerSharingRegistry`);

### Non-Breaking

- Renamed address type variables to more consistent naming

- Update chainsync timeout: Increase the minimum timeout from 90s to 135s and switch from picking
                            from an array of 5 values to a range of timeouts. This change reduces
                            the risk of synchronosation among nodes in the network.

### Patch

- `ouroboros-consensus-diffusion`: `ouroboros-network` packages version bumps.
