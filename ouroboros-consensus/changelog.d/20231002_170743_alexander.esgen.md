- Rename `NewTipInfo` (contained in the trace constructors
  `AddedToCurrentChain`/`SwitchedToAFork`) to `SelectionChangedInfo`, and add
  the `SelectView`s of the old and the new tip. Concrete motivation is that
  these contain the tie-breaker VRF which is very useful to have at hand in
  various cases.
