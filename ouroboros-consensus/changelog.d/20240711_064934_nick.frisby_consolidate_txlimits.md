### Breaking

- Consolidate `TxLimits` in the mempool.
     - Remove `Mempool.`getTxSize`; the snapshot interface contains byte sizes
       now.

     - Transaction size, block capacity, and mempool capacity are
       multi-dimensional vectors (`ExUnits`, etc), instead of merely bytes:
       `TxMeasure`.

     - A transaction cannot be added if it would push any component of the size
       over that component of the mempool capacity.

     - The mempool capacity override is still specified in terms of bytes, but
       the magnitude is interpreted via division as a block count, rounded up.

- Pass a correctly-sized prefix of the mempool to the forging functions,
  instead of its entire contents. The mempool's finger tree is best way to find
  that cutoff.
