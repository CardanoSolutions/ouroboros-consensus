### Breaking

- Added a new `InFutureCheck` to the ChainSync client, which requires
  additional arguments to the 'chainSyncClient' definition. The node no longer
  propagates headers/blocks from the future: a ChainSync client thread now
  sleeps until the received header is no longer from the future.
